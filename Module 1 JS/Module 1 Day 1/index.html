    Execution Trigger

    Final Summary: How They Differ
Feature	Console Execution	HTML File Execution
Execution Trigger	Manual input	Runs when the page loads
Parsing Behavior	No parsing needed	Runs during HTML parsing
DOM Availability	Always available	Depends on script placement
Blocking Behavior	No blocking	Blocks parsing (unless async/defer is used)
Scope	Limited to session	Full page context
