# JavaScript Interview Questions and Expert Answers

## 1. What is JavaScript?


`What is JavaScript, and why is it used in web development?` 



JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamically typed, prototype-based scripting language that allows developers to create interactive web applications. It enables DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous communication, and animations, making it essential for modern web development.


--



`How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages like Python or Java?` 

- **JavaScript vs. Python**: JS runs in the browser, while Python is mainly used for backend development and data science.
- **JavaScript vs. Java**: Java is compiled and strongly typed, whereas JS is interpreted and dynamically typed.
- **JavaScriptâ€™s Key Edge**: Its ability to run directly in the browser without requiring compilation makes it the go-to language for web interactivity.


--



`What are the key differences between Client-side JavaScript and Server-side JavaScript?` 

- **Client-side JS** runs in the browser, handling UI interactions and DOM updates.
- **Server-side JS** (using Node.js) runs on the backend, handling API calls, database interactions, and file systems.
- Example: A button click triggering an alert (client-side) vs. fetching user data from a database (server-side).


--




`Can JavaScript be used outside the browser? If yes, how?` 

Yes, JavaScript can be run outside the browser using **Node.js**, which allows it to interact with filesystems, databases, and build server-side applications.



--




`Explain dynamic typing in JavaScript and its pros/cons.` 

- **Dynamic typing** means variable types are assigned at runtime.
- **Pros**: Flexibility, faster development.
- **Cons**: More prone to runtime errors, harder debugging.

## 2. History & Evolution



`Who created JavaScript, and what was its original name?` 

Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995 at Netscape. It was initially called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript** (for marketing reasons).



--




`What is ECMAScript, and how is it related to JavaScript?` 

ECMAScript (ES) is the standardized specification for JavaScript, maintained by **TC39**. JavaScript follows ECMAScript guidelines.



--




`What was introduced in ES5, and why was it significant?` 

- **Strict Mode** (`"use strict"`) for better error handling.
- JSON support (`JSON.stringify()` & `JSON.parse()`).
- Array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.


--




`Why was ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) a major milestone for JavaScript?` 

ES6 introduced:

- `let` & `const`
- Arrow functions (`=>`)
- Template literals
- Classes
- Modules (`import/export`)
- Promises


--




`What is TC39, and what role does it play in JavaScript evolution?` 

TC39 is the **technical committee** responsible for evolving JavaScript. They define ECMAScript updates and process proposals in stages.

## 3. JavaScript Versions (ES5, ES6+)



`What are the major differences between ES5 and ES6?` 

- ES5 uses `var`, ES6 introduced `let` and `const`.
- ES6 added arrow functions, classes, and template literals.
- Modules were introduced (`import/export`).


--




`Why were `let` and `const` introduced in ES6? How do they differ from `var`?` 

- `let` is block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped.
- `const` is also block-scoped but prevents reassignment.


--




`Explain Arrow Functions (`=>`) and how they differ from traditional functions.` 

- **Arrow functions** provide a shorter syntax: `const sum = (a, b) => a + b;`
- They do **not** have their own `this` context.


--




`What is Destructuring, and how does it simplify JavaScript code?` 

Destructuring allows easy extraction of values:

```js
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = user; // Extracts name and age
```



--




`What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?` 

- `null` is an **explicit** absence of value.
- `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.

## 4. How JavaScript Works in Browsers



`Explain the JavaScript Execution Process in browsers.` 

1. **Parsing** â€“ Code is read and converted into AST.
2. **Compilation** â€“ JIT compilation happens in modern JS engines.
3. **Execution** â€“ Code runs in the call stack.


--




`What is the Event Loop, and why is it important?` 

The **event loop** ensures asynchronous code execution in JavaScriptâ€™s single-threaded environment by continuously checking the **call stack** and **callback queue**.



--




`How does JavaScript manage concurrency with callbacks, promises, and async/await?` 

- **Callbacks**: Old approach, leads to callback hell.
- **Promises**: Modern approach to handle async operations.
- **Async/Await**: Cleaner syntax using Promises.
